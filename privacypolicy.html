You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you:<br>

-The categories of personal information we collected about you<br>

You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.<br>

We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:<br>

-Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.<br>

-Emailing privacy@phytagesupport.com<br>
-Writing to us at the address in the "Contacting Us" section of this Privacy Policy.<br>

If you have any questions or comments about this CCPA notice, the ways in which we collect and use your information described in this privacy policy, your choices and rights regarding such use, or wish to exercise your rights under California law, please do not hesitate to contact us using the methods stated.<br>

Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.<br>

You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:<br>

-Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.<br>
-Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.<br>

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.<br>

<h3>CCPA - Response Timing and Format</h3>
We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.<br>

Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.<br>

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.<br>

We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:<br>
